# Triangular Drawdio!

## What is it?

It is a remix of [Jay Silver's original Drawdio](http://web.media.mit.edu/~silver/drawdio/), the main difference being the new triangular shape. It is designed to be printed on a single side copper laminate and uses two coin cells as the primary power source.

## What can I do with it?

Anything! Just don't blame me if you happen blow things up. Feel free to hack it, or make it your own.

## Licensing Information

I don't have any proper licence for this thing. What this basically means that if something goes wrong (like aliens coming and abducting you), you are responsible. Use whatever that is there in this repo at your own risk.
